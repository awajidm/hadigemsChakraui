    "description": "<p>Aquamarine ( Latin-water of the sea) is so named because of its seawater color. A dark blue is the most desired color. The coloring agent is iron. Lower qualities are heated to 725-850 degrees F ( 400-450 degrees C) to change them to the desired, permanent aquamarine blue. Higher heat will lead to discoloration. Care must be taken when making jewelry! Colors can also be improved wit neutron and gamma irradiation, but these changes do not last. Aquamarine is brittle and sensitive to pressure. Inclusions of fine, oriented hollow rods or aligned foreign minerals rarely cause a cat&#8217;s-eye effect or asterism with six-rayed stars with a vivid sheen.</p>\n",
